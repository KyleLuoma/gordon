Prompt: You are an AI assistant tasked with extracting structured data from unstructured recipe text. Your goal is to read through a recipe text file and create a JSON list of ingredient items. Each ingredient item in the JSON list should have the following fields:

1. `name`: The name of the ingredient (e.g., "sugar", "flour", "olive oil"). This name must be limited to the base item and not include unneeded adjectives (e.g., use black pepper instead of freshly ground black pepper). This is so that we can limit redundant entries in our recipe database.
2. `unit`: The unit of measurement (e.g., "cups", "tablespoons", "grams"). If no unit is specified, use `null`.
3. `amount`: The quantity of the ingredient (e.g., "1", "2.5", "a pinch"). If no amount is specified, use `null`.

The input recipe text may contain additional information such as instructions or notes, but you should focus only on extracting the ingredients. Ensure the JSON output is well-structured and valid.

If one of the ingredients aligns with one of the ingredients that already exists in our database, then use the same name as the existing entry. If the ingredient is not in our database, then we will add it as a new entry using the list that you provide. Here is a list of existing ingredients in our database:

- white sugar
- white flour
- olive oil
- salt
- black pepper
- garlic clove

- chicken broth
- corned beef

- Dijon mustard
- honey
- salt
- black pepper
- garlic clove
- dried chile
- ginger
- shrimp
- shallots

- corn oil


Here are the units of measurement that already exist in our database:

Directions
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Heat oil in a large, oven proof skillet over medium-high heat. Add peppers and onions and cook, undisturbed, 5 minutes or until browned. Add chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt and pepper and continue cooking until vegetables are soft, stirring often, 1 to 2  minutes. Remove vegetables from the pan and set aside.

Add butter to the pan and melt over moderate heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add in tomatoes and broth and cook until thick and creamy, stirring constantly, about 3 minutes. Stir in chicken and beans. Top chicken mixture with 1 cup cheese. Spread reserved peppers and onions evenly over the cheese and top with chips and remaining cheese.

Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned on top, about 15  minutes. Serve with desired toppings.
